## About The Project
Inari is a plugin/framework for creating custom pickers and control UIs for digital media pipelines. The underlying framework is developed with easy extensibility in mind, making Inari ideal for all sorts of custom tools. Inari is not built for one specific software, but rather using a bridge architecture allowing the Inari core to have cross-software support. The bridges only needs to implement a few application specific methods and provide window for the Inari master widget. Stuff like window docking is therefore controlled by the host application, which typically makes docking work right out of the box!
